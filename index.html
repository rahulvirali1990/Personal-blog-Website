               <h5>
                    The lathe was very important to the Industrial Revolution. 
                    It is known as the mother of machine tools, as it was the first machine tool that led to the invention of other machine tools.   
                    The first fully documented, all-metal slide rest lathe was invented by Jacques de Vaucanson around 1751.

                            Small hand-held routers use a spinning cylindrical blade, similar to a drill bit, to cut out the material. 
                            The spindle bit spins at a very high speed, around 25,000 rpm.
