To ensure accuracy, Haas manufactures all critical components in-house using dedicated state-of-the-art CNC machine tools.</p>
  <p> The company’s 1.1-million-square-foot facility makes extensive use the latest lean manufacturing methods and just-in-time production practices to streamline production capabilities and reduce costs. 
     This, combined with highly trained teams for electronics and mechanical assembly, allows Haas to control quality, cost, reliability, and availability. The resulting savings and increased quality are passed on to the customer in the form of lower prices and better products.
</p><p>
    Of the nearly 300 chip-making machine tools in the Haas machine shop, more than two-thirds are Haas machines – proof positive that the company believes in its own products. To increase production capacity and capability,
     new manufacturing equipment is added constantly, allowing Haas to produce more parts more efficiently, and further reduce the cost of Haas products to the end user.
    </p><p>
    Today, Haas manufactures four major product lines: vertical machining centers (VMCs), horizontal machining centers (HMCs), CNC lathes, and rotary tables, as well as a number of large five-axis and specialty machines. All Haas products are manufactured at the company’s expansive facility in Oxnard, California – the largest, most modern machine tool manufacturing operation in the United States.
