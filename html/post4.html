        Machine tools are a vital part of many industries. They are responsible for forming the foundations of homes we live in, crafting the tools we use, and creating items that are commonplace in our lives; in short, we wouldn't be the advanced society we are without the power and precision behind machine shop supplies. Milling machines fall under the machine tool category.
         </p>
         <p> At their very core, milling machines are designed to shape materials (usually wood, metal, or other solid substances). With the help of computer-aided design (CAD) programs, they can be positioned in either vertical or horizontal orientation to carve out materials based on a pre-existing design. Their versatility when it comes to movement allows them to function dynamically: many can perform multi-axis machining with ease. Here are three types of milling machines you might encounter in a machine shop.
