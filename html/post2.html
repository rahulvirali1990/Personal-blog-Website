      <p>  Browse through our select pre-owned inventory using our Smart Search interface, and narrow down your search with simple filter options. First, select a Category and a specific type of machine. Once your options are listed, refine your search by filtering by Brand, Age, Price and Control. You'll have access to the most relevant options on each machine. Compare up to three machines at a time for the most accurate perspective.
